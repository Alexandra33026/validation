      To prevent form submission when the validation fails, you `could` bind the disabled attribute of the button to the validation's result.
      Because visual clues are only provided once a field is 'dirty', this could lead to a weird user experience.
      Without changing the first-name, the user does not know why this submit button is disabled.

  <smart-example base="form-submission/check-all" title="Calling checkAll()" >
    <markdown>
      In contrast, this example always has the submit button enabled.
      When you execute it, however, the code first calls the validation's *checkAll()* function.
      This ensures the complete validation is re-ran with latest values, as well as forcing all fields to be considered 'dirty', leading to a better user experience.
