    ### notEmpty()
    This is a special case, dictating that the field is 'required' and cannot be empty.
    Empty means null, undefined, '', or if it has a length property (arrays and strings) that the length is 0.

    >Strings are always trimmed before they evaluated.


    >The notEmpty rule is always checked first before any other validation rule.  This means that without the notEmpty rule, the .betweenLength(3,30) rule would still consider a value of '' as valid because the field is allowed to be empty.
